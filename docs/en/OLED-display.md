# OLED display

Due to prolonged operation, issues such as screen burn-in may occur with the OLED. Therefore, the OLED has the following logic: upon initial startup, `oled_enable` is set to `1` by default, meaning the OLED screen will remain constantly on. If `oled_enable` is set to `0`, the screen will display every 5 minutes after the device has been running for 300 minutes, significantly extending the screen's lifespan.

To customize this behavior, you can locate the following configuration in `/usr/bin/blikvm/package.json`.

```json
"oled":{
    "oled_enable": 1,
    "restart_show_time": 300,
    "interval_display_time": 5
}
```

Modify the values of `restart_show_time` and `interval_display_time` in minutes to achieve different control effects.
