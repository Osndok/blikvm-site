## **Installation requirements**

!!! note "If you have an assembly kit, you will need the following things"
    - Raspberry CM4 with 1Gb RAM or more.
    - USB-C to USB-A cable.
    - HDMI cable.
    - Straight Ethernet cable (for the ATX board connection).
    - Power supply unit (5.1V 3A USB-C, recommended by the Raspberry Pi).

!!! warning "Power supply"
    You must use a USB-C to USB-A cable. Using a USB-C to USB-C cable will not work. This is an incompatibility in the hardware design and will be fixed in a later version.

## **Basic setup**

**1.** The SD card preloaded with the factory default image does not require burning. If you need to reflash the system or for DIY purposes, you can follow[Flash the memory card or eMMC](./flashing_os.md)

**2.** If you have a non-plug version, refer to the video and instructions below for device installation:  

1. Use the provided screwdriver to open the metal casing and remove the PCB motherboard.
2. Install the CM4 onto the PCB motherboard, ensuring that the two rows of card slots are aligned. Apply the thermal conductive silicone pad onto the CM4 main chip to facilitate heat dissipation using the metal casing.
The fan is not connected by default as the metal casing provides sufficient heat dissipation. Depending on your CM4 version, selectively install the Wi-Fi antenna.  
3. Reassemble the PCB motherboard and the metal casing to complete the installation.  
4. Please note that translations might vary depending on context and specific terminology used in technical instructions.

* HDMI IN and otg port must be connected to the computer. ATX too, but itâ€™s optional, read below.
There should be no USB hub between BLIKVM and the computer, as some UEFI/BIOS cannot detect them at the boot stage.
BLIKVM supports 1080p60Hz or lower about HDMI source.
* Connect Ethernet to the network and PWR IN to the BLIKVM power supply.

**4.** **ATX connection**

**5.** After all the connecting cables are properly set up, power on the BliKVM until the display screen shows an image, indicating that the device has successfully started.

**6.** Read the [**"First Steps"** guide](./first_steps.md) carefully. It provides instructions on how to find the device on the network, how to log in, change passwords, and more. Follow the steps described there and then return to this page.

!!! warning "As BliKVM v1 also supports PiKVM OS, if your v1 comes with PiKVM as the factory OS, please refer to the documentation for web usage [instructions](https://docs.pikvm.org/)."

**7.** **Try managing your computer using the BliKVM web interface.** Make sure you can see the image and that the keyboard and mouse are working properly. If you encounter any issues, check out our [FAQ](./faq.md) (it's very helpful). If you find no solution there, seek support in our [Discord chat room](https://discord.com/invite/9Y374gUF6C).

## **Wi-Fi Antenna Connection**

!!! info "If your CM4 has Wi-Fi functionality, open the metal casing of v1 and attach the Wi-Fi antenna from the package to the IPX interface on the CM4, as shown by the red box in the diagram below; the installation location on the casing for the antenna is defined as position 11 in the interface layout diagram."

## **Support 1080p60hz HDMI input**

First in V2.2 version, there is CSI channel switch. This switch is switch 2 csi channels or 4 csi channels.
In other versions, the switch is obsolete. Newer keeps the factory state, ignore this switch. Only flip the switch when the device is powered off, otherwise it may cause permanent damage! The four small switches should be up or down at the same time.
