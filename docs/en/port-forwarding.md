# **Port forwarding**

After v1.4.7 version If your ISP provides an external IP address for the router, you can configure Port forwarding to access BliKVM:

* If the web interface uses the HTTP protocol and occupies port 80;
* If the web interface uses the HTTPS protocol and occupies port 443;
If you do not have an external IP address, we suggest trying to use [Tailscale VPN](./tailscale.md)ã€‚
