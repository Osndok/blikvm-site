# ATXA guide

## **1. Introduction**
ATXA is an ATX adapter borad to manage the power of your computer. 
The product includes two modules A-board and B-board. A-board is connected to the Raspberry Pi, 
B-board is connected to the computer's motherboard, and A-board is connected to B-board through a 
network cable.Join to the <a href="https://discord.gg/9Y374gUF6C" target="_blank">Discord Community Chat</a> for news,

 A-board is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The following table is a typical connection method in BLIKVM and PiKVM application.

| A-board | RPI4   |
| ------- | ------ |
| GND     | GND    |
| 3V3     | 3V3    |
| LED PWR | GPIO24 |
| LED HDD | GPIO22 |
| SW PWR  | GPIO23 |
| SW RST  | GPIO27 |

A-board is connected to B-board through a network cable. The following table is the corresponding relationship between the pin status of A-board and B-board.

|  Pins on A-board  |                          Pins on B-board                           |
|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  LED PWR is HIGH  |                 LED PWR+ is HIGH,  LED PWR- is LOW                 |
|  LED PWR is LOW   |                 LED PWR+ is LOW,  LED PWR- is LOW                  |
|  LED HDD is HIGH  |                 LED HDD+ is HIGH,  LED HDD- is LOW                 |
|  LED HDD is LOW   |                 LED HDD+ is LOW,  LED HDD- is LOW                  |
|  SW PWR is HIGH   |    BTN PWR+ and BTN PWR- connected, the power button is pressed    |
|   SW PWR is LOW   | BTN PWR+ and BTN PWR- disconnected, the power button is unpressed  |
|  SW RST is HIGH   |    BTN RST+ and BTN RST- connected, the reset button is pressed    |
|   SW RST is LOW   | BTN RST+ and BTN RST- disconnected, the reset button is unpressed  |

## **3. B-board**

The b-board has an adapted full-height and half-height metal PCI mounting plate, which can be installed on the computer case. The user connects the pins on the B-board to the ATX control interface on the computer motherboard using the color DuPont cables provided with the product.

!!! info "ATXA-B与电脑主板连接说明"
    根据电脑主板说明，首先找到主板上ATX功能相关引脚位置，拔下主板已经接好的ATX线，拔下后电脑的电源按钮将失去作用。ATXA-B主板共有两排8PIN引脚，两排引脚功能完全相同使用时无需区分。其中一排引脚用于KVM控制ATX相关功能，另一排引脚接主板上拔下来的ATX杜邦头，保持原有机箱电源按钮功能。根据主板和ATX-B上的具体引脚定义进行每根线的连接，连接关系可以参考下图：
