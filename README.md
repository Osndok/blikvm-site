## Establishment of development environment

If you don't know about mkdocs, please study from <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/" target="_blank">mkdocs website</a>. When you follow the website and set up the use environment of mkdocs, you can run the project with the following command to preview:

```bash
mkdocs serve -f config/en/mkdocs.yml
```

You can change language path, if you modify chinese part, the command like this:

```bash
mkdocs serve -f config/zh/mkdocs.yml
```

If there is no problem with the environment installation, you will see an output similar to the following. You can preview the website by inputting the IP address (eg:http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to the browser.

```bash
(venv) shangbinbin@shangbibindeMBP blikvm-site % mkdocs serve -f config/en/mkdocs.yml
INFO     -  Building documentation...
INFO     -  Cleaning site directory
INFO     -  Documentation built in 1.08 seconds
INFO     -  [16:56:09] Watching paths for changes: 'docs/en', 'config/en/mkdocs.yml'
INFO     -  [16:56:09] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
INFO     -  [16:56:12] Browser connected: http://127.0.0.1:8000/update/
```

When the preview results are confirmed to be correct, you can use the following command to complete the compilation and packaging. Then you can merge your commit by PR.

```
